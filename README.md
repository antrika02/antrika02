## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate developer who believes that **tech is most powerful when it’s purposeful**.  
From facing multiple rejections to becoming a **Contributor at Social Summer of Code (SSoC)**, I’ve learned that **resilience writes the best code**.

I’m currently exploring:
- 🧠 Deep system design & backend development
- 🛠️ Scalable real-world software architectures
- 🌐 Impactful open-source contributions
- 💬 Community-driven innovation

> “Rejections taught me persistence. Open source taught me purpose.”
